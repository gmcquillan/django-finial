![Alt text](finial.png "Example of a finial in architecture.")

1. A distinctive ornament at the apex of a roof, pinnacle, canopy, or
similar structure.
2. An ornament at the top, end, or corner of an object such as a post,
piece of furniture, etc.

You might see the relation given that this project's goal is to create a
sparse branch of templates for each override, thus "decorating" the
"top" of your existing templates hierarchy.
